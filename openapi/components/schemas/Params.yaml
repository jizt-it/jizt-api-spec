description: The summary generation parameters.
type: object
properties:
  relative_max_length:
    description: >
      The maximum length of the summary to be generated,
      relative to the length of the original text.
    type: number
    format: float
    minimum: 0.1
    maximum: 1.0
    example: 0.5
  relative_min_length:
    description: >
      The minimum length of the summary to be generated,
      relative to the length of the original text.
    type: number
    format: float
    minimum: 0.1
    maximum: 1.0
    example: 0.1
  do_sample:
    description: >
      Whether or not to use sampling. If set to `false` greedy
      decoding is used.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  early_stopping:
    description: >
      Whether or not to stop the beam search when at least `num_beams`
      sentences are finished per batch or not.
    type: boolean
    example: false
  num_beams:
    description: >
      Number of beams for beam search. If set to `1` no beam search
      is performed. The higher the number, the longer the summary
      will take to be generated, but its quality will likely be better.
    type: integer
    format: int32
    example: 4
  temperature:
    description: >
      The value used to module the next token probabilities.
    type: number
    format: float
    example: 1.0
  top_k:
    description: >
      The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to
      keep for top-k-filtering.
    type: integer
    format: int32
    example: 4
  top_p:
    description: >
      If set to less than `1`, only the most probable tokens with
      probabilities that add up to `top_p` or higher are kept
      for generation.
    type: number
    format: float
    example: 1.0
  repetition_penalty:
    description: >
      The parameter for repetition penalty. If set to `1.0` there
      is no penalty. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858.pdf)
      for more details.
    type: number
    format: float
    example: 1.0
  length_penalty:
    description: >
      Exponential penalty to the length. If set to `1.0` there
      is no penalty.

      - Values < `1.0` encourage the model to generate shorter
      summaries.

      - Values > `1.0` encourage the model to produce longer
      summaries.
    type: number
    format: float
    example: 1.0
  no_repeat_ngram_size:
    description: >
      If set to greater than `0`, all n-grams of that size
      can only occur once.
    type: integer
    format: int32
    example: 4
