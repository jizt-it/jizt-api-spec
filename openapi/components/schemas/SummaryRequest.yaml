      Jizt makes use of the latest advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
      using state-of-the-art language generation models, such as Google's T5 model, to
      provide accurate and complete abstractive summaries.
  model:
    $ref: './Model.yaml'

      Whether to cache the summary or not. If set to `false`, the summary will be
      deleted once it has been completed and a `GET` request with its id has been
      made once. The generated summary is automatically deleted if the `GET` request
      is not made within 5 minutes after having requested it via `POST`.
      
      If set to `true`, future requests with the same source text will be immediate,
      since the summary will be cached. If the source text contains sensitive
      information, it is recommended to set this attribute to `false`. If not, setting
      it to `true` helps speed up the service thanks to caching.
